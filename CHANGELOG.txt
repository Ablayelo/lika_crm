  ------------
    # Blocks:
        * New blocks :
            - 'History' (timeline).
            - 'Received billing documents'.
        * Blocks with state (open/close & show/hide empty fields) :
            - Blocks are now faded when folded ; icon is reduced, and buttons reduced.
            - Empty fields can be hidden.
        * New blocks locations system :
            - Nearly all blocks are now configurable (can be placed, or even removed).
            - Detailviews : the blocks can be located on top, left side, right side or bottom.
            - Portal & home : are now separated from the content types blocks configuration.
            - New view "My page" : it looks like the "Home" view, but each user can set the present blocks.
        * All relations blocks are reloaded when a change occurs on a block dependent from relations.
    # Deletion of users (& teams) with files assignation to an other user.
    # UI :
        * Improved scrolling for the side menu.
        * Portals have not yet the same name in the prefered menu.
        * Can delete all (allowed) relations on relation block in one click.
        * Lots of choices are now smartly ordered (eg: predicates in relation creation popup).
    # Credentials improved :
        * Credentials by type of Entity (ContentType).
        * Exportable types credentials (to export a listview for these types as CSV files).
    # Theme manager ; 2 themes are embedded : the old one become "Chantilly", and a new one has been created ("Ice cream").
