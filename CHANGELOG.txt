== Version 1.2 ==

  Users side :
  ------------
    # New inner edition feature : the most fields can be edited directly in the detail/list views.
    # A new view that merges 2 entities.
    # Light batch process : several entities returned by a filtered are modified with the same pattern :
        - String actions : 'To upper case', 'To lower case', 'Prefix', 'Suffix', 'Remove a sub-string'...
        - Integer actions : 'Add', 'Subtract', 'Multiply', 'Divide'.
    # New SemiFixedRelationType model that allows to accelerate the creation of Relation when one branch is always the same.
    # The deletion of small models (status/sector etc...) is better managed (protected or FK are set to NULL).
    # CSV import : the 'dialect' of the CSV file is now guessed.
    # Apps :
        * Emails :
            - The raw text and the HTML text of the bodies of emails (standalone ones and grouped by campaigns ones) can be written separately.
            - A standalone email can be created from a template as base.
        * Billing :
            - Line management was improved : you can create/edit/delete several lines at once.
            - Line fields can be edited directly.
            - Status of Invoice/Quote/Sales Order/Credit Note are ordered by config.
            - Numbers of Invoices are now editable, and all status can be chosen at creation.
        * Activities :
            - List views for meetings and phone calls.
            - Activities can be created directly in the Calendar view.
            - The view to add participants from the detailview of an Activity has been improved (it manages users like in the Activity creation view).
        * Assistants :
            - New FunctionFields for 'Todos', Memos' & 'Alerts'.
        * Opportunities :
            - Sales Phases are ordered by configuration.

        * Commercial:
            - The relationship type 'is related to the opportunity' has been removed.
    # Bug fixes :
        * Creme_config: only superusers can create/edit Users.
        * Activities: 'participates' relationship is now internal (to manage correctly Calendars).
        * Internal relationships are no more automatically cloned (eg: it caused problems when cloning an Organisation targeted by an Invoice).
        * Some HTML escaping problems fixed.
        * ...
