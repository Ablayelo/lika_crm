You have to know how to install a Django application.
See the creme/settings.py and set your parameters (or put them in a new file called creme/local_settings.py instead).
When you have chosen the creme apps you want (by commenting the unwanted ones), and configured the DB parameters
run the following command in the creme/ directory:
>> python manage.py syncdb
>> python manage.py generatemedia
[Do not worry about 'URL not found' messages]
>> python manage.py creme_populate -v
