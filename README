INSTALL:
You have to know how to install a Django application.

Upgrade notice : if you already have a Creme installation, upgrade the version one by one
(eg: do not try to upgrade from 1.1 to 1.3, ugrade to 1.2 and then 1.3).

See the creme/settings.py and set your parameters (or put them in a new file called creme/local_settings.py instead).
When you have chosen the creme apps you want (by commenting the unwanted ones), and configured the DB parameters
run the following commands in the root directory:
>> python manage.py syncdb
[if it is the initial installation, you are asked if you want to create a new user ; you should create one]

>> python manage.py migrate
>> python manage.py generatemedia
[Do not worry about 'URL not found' messages]
>> python manage.py creme_populate

If you are upgrading from Creme 1.2, run the following command:
>> python manage.py convert_naive_datetimes
